# stock-analysis - Hello World!

**Overview of the Project**
The purpose of VBA is to create macros to process data and generate an automate repetitive word, functions, and visualizations. It's to address the variable and custom forms for data input. Knowing how to format in macros, one essentially can see routines from the start to end. In other words, it is taking an abstraction in numericle terms.

**Results**
Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the proper results of this analysis as I have received many errors, such as Overflow (Error 6) and Compile Error: Expected: end of statement. Apparently, in my version of Excel, debugging does not work. After communicating with tutor and Learning Assistant, I may need more time to sort this matter. Hopefully, in the upcoming week, I can go back and reassess where it went wrong and resubmit the work. 

**Summary**
The Advantageous of refactoring code in general are (1) improving the design of code, (2) finding bugs in the design and make it much easier to understand. **HOWEVER,** there are disadvantges of the original and refactored VBA script. For instance, there's simply no time for it. With a large data and short deadline, there would be a few issues along the way. After testing repeatedly, it is clear I ran into couple of them.
